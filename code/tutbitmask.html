	    <h4>introduction to bitwise operators</h4>
	    <p>bitwise operators perform operations on bits</p>
	    <p>C provides 6 bitwise operators for us to use</p>
	    <p>such bitwise operators work on integral types only, not floating points, try to avoid using them with signed numbers as they may yield unwanted results</p>
	    <p>(i.e since C99, left shift &lt;&lt; operator on signed numbers have undefined behaviour or right shift &gt;&gt; operators have implementation defined behavour on signed numbers)</p>

	    <h4>BITWISE NOT</h4>
	    <p>
	    A bitwise NOT inverts the bits of a number(i.e it flips 0 to 1 and 1 to 0), 
	    for example, take the number 2, which has a binary representation of 0000 0010 in 8 bits, a bitwise NOT would invert all of
	    it to 1111 1101, which is -3 in two's complement, essentially it has the same effect as negating a number and then subtracting one from it, thus 2 becomes -2 -1 = -3.
	    </p>
	    <p>------</p>
	    <p>OPTIONAL READING FOR ADVANCED READERS:</p>
	    <p>
	    In an unsigned system, the MSB(most significant bit) does NOT represent the sign of a number so bitwise NOT-ing
	    2 in an unsigned system becomes 253, since 1111 1101 in an unsigned system IS 253.
	    </p>
	    <p>------</p>

	    <h5>code example</h5>
	    <code>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{         
    printf("%d\n", ~4);
    return 0;          
}
</pre>
	    </code>

	    <p> output: -5 </p>
	    <h4>TRY IT YOURSELF</h4>
	    <ol>
		<li>predict the output of bitwise NOT'ing 8</li>
		<li>take the binary representation of 4 and bitwise NOT it</li>
	    </ol>
	    <hr>
	    <h4>bitwise AND</h4>
	    <p>
	    bitwise AND essentially checks if two bits are on(1) or not(0), it outputs 1 ONLY if two bits are 1, or else it outputs 0, for example, lets take 1(binary
	    representation: 0000 0001 in 8 bits) and lets take 2(binary representation: 0000 0010 in 8 bits), lets AND them together now: 1 &amp; 2, the result would be 0,
	    why you may ask? to answer that, lets work it through.
	    </p>

	    <table>
		<tr>
		    <td>"1"</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>"2"</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		    <td>0</td>

		    <td>AND'ing them</td>

		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		</tr>
	    </table>
	    <p>See how no two bits were 1 at the same position/column? when two bits are not 1 at the same position, AND outputs a 0 for that position.</p>
	    <p>
	    Now try bitwise and'ing 3 and 10? what do you think the output will be? 3 &amp; 10 = 2. How? let's work through it!
	    </p>
	    <table>
		<tr>
		    <td>"10"</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>"3"</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>AND'ing them</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		    <td>1</td>
		    <td>0</td>
		</tr>
	    </table>
	    <p>
	    look at the second bit(the second last column) and see how both of them have a 1 bit at that position? Bitwise AND returns 1 if both bits at the same position are 
	    1 and as expected we got 1 as an output at that position, so the overall output of the bitwise AND operation is 0000 0010, 
	    which converted to decimal(the number system we use)
	    is 2, hence the output of 3 &amp; 10 is 2.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Now we're going to show a truth table here, what it does is show how an AND gate (or in our case, bitwise AND operator) behaves with inputs, which in our case are bits.
